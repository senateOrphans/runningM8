## Running M8 Technology

## Installation Instructions

## Unsolved Problems / Future Features
 * The system allows registration of the same username with different capitalization.
 * Currently, the application only recognizes one setting for a marathon training plan. If the user wanted to use this application year after year, it does not yet have this functionality.
 * When a user attempts to logs-in with the wrong information, the button breaks for them to change their minds and register a new account. Similarly, if they are registering and receive an error that the username already exists, the button breaks for them to go log-in instead.
 * Password recovery
 * Take data from Active.com to auto-fill marathon information
 * Provide charts using chart.js
 * Additional metrics (average mileage per week, pace, etc.)
 * Additional views (total, month-by-month, etc.)

## Fix Today?
 * Add ability to jump back 1 - 4 weeks
 * Change every other row color on countdown
